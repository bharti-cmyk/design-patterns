# Design Patterns: Strategy & Observer in TypeScript (NestJS)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates two core behavioral design patterns:

- **Strategy Pattern**: Allows switching between different algorithms (e.g., payment methods).
- **Observer Pattern**: Enables real-time notification logic by broadcasting changes to multiple listeners.

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategy Pattern

### âœ… What It Is

The **Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets you choose the behavior at runtime without modifying the core logic.

### âœ… Where Itâ€™s Used

In this project, we use it for **Payment Processing**:

- `PaymentProcessor` is the context.
- `UpiPayment`, `StripePayment`, `PaypalPayment` are strategies.
- The client can switch between strategies dynamically (e.g., based on user input or config).

### âœ… Why Itâ€™s Decoupled

- The `PaymentProcessor` doesn't know which algorithm it uses.
- You can easily add a new payment method (e.g., `ApplePay`) without changing the processor.

## ðŸ§  Observer Pattern

### âœ… What It Is

The **Observer Pattern** allows an object (Subject) to notify other objects (Observers) when its state changes. It supports event-driven systems.

### âœ… Where Itâ€™s Used

In our **notification system**:

- `UserActivityService` is the Subject.
- `NotificationService` and `LoggerService` are Observers.
- When a user creates a post, both observers react â€” one sends notifications, one logs the event.

### âœ… Why Itâ€™s Decoupled

- `UserActivityService` doesnâ€™t care whoâ€™s listening.
- You can add/remove observers without touching the core logic.
- This makes the system easy to scale and extend.

## ðŸ”§ Extensibility Benefits

| Pattern     | Easily Add New...      | Without Modifying...       |
|-------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Strategy    | Payment method          | `PaymentProcessor` logic   |
| Observer    | Reactions to activity   | `UserActivityService`      |
